## üõ† Environment Setup

This repository uses Conda for environment management. To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azniosman/DSAI-Assignments.git
cd DSAI-Assignments

# Create conda environment from environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate dsai
```

If you've already cloned the repository without submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
